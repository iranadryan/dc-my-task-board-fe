## Overview

![screenshot](/cover.png)

This was my shot at the full stack My Task Board, a simple project but very complete one, that uses database, CRUD functions in the both sides. In the demo you can create tasks, setting title, description, icon and status, update any of its data and delete the tasks, you can also change the board title and description, after make any change you can notice the URL changes, when you access the same url later you can see the board with all modifications you made and keep changing.

Even though it is a simple and small project, I treated it with all the seriousness that I would treat a real project, always seeking to organize the code, use clean code paradigms, use good tools and libraries, create robust and reusable solutions, as was done with error handling, the form validation, transferring the best regardless of the size of the project.

All code was written in TypeScript both frontend and backend. I listed bellow the tools used in the project:
